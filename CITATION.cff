  A workflow for collecting, processing, and analysing
  scientific literature data that cites data modilsed by the
  Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The initial
  script systematically queries the GBIF literature API to
  retrieve and filter relevant, peer-reviewed publications,
  storing the results for further analysis.  It then
  processes each dataset through iterative downloading and
  extraction processes, ensuring only pertinent information,
  such as preserved specimen records, is retained.

  The subsequent script focuses on topic analysis by
  extracting thematic topics associated with each
  publication and constructing a network graph to visualize
  their co-occurrences. This network analysis highlights the
  interrelationships between research themes within the
  biodiversity literature, offering valuable insights into
  research trends and the thematic structure of studies that
  utilize GBIF data.
