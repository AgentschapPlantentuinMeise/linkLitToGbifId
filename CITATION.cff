  This repository provides a Python script for analysis and
  visualization of metadata from the Global Biodiversity
  Information Facility (GBIF) API. It processes data from
  CSV files, fetches metadata for DOIs, and generates a
  variety of outputs, including detailed Markdown summaries,
  PDFs, network graphs of keywords and topics, global
  choropleth maps of researcher distributions, and word
  clouds based on publication abstracts and keywords. The
  script is designed to facilitate the exploration and
  presentation of biodiversity data for research and
  educational purposes.
